# Example-11.4

An insurance company wants to determine the location of five office cubicles of varying dimensions in the top floor of its headquarters. These offices do not have any interaction with offices in other floors. Work sampling was recently conducted, and the number of trips made by personnel between these five offices in a 12-month period was estimated. The estimated trips and office dimensions are provided in Figure 11.25. Use ABSMODEL 2 to formulate the problem.
We make these assumptions.
 1. The cost of moving unit distance between any pair of offices is the same.
 2. The clearance between the offices in both directions is zero.
 3. The offices are oriented so that their longer sides are horizontal.
